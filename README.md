# url-cycle
 
In essence, this script provides a way to cycle through a list of URLs, giving higher priority to certain URLs if desired. The user can control the URL list via a JSON file and the priority behavior via command-line arguments. The use of `wait_key()` allows for manual control over the cycle, and `cls()` keeps the console output clean
